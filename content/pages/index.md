[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a serious of programming puzzles published every December since 2015. Every day, from 1st to 25th, you'll get a 2-part programming challenge. It's a great way to improve your programming skills, maybe learn a new language or new tricks in the one you already know. Each year the challenges start simple, but after a few days they become, well, challenging. What's important it's they are quite fun - unlike other programming puzzles I tried in the past, they don't focus too much on maths and theoretical CS, and they are linked by a story.

## Choosing a programming language

I solved most tasks with **Python**. It's the easiest choice, as the language provides useful data structures (eg. sets and 2D arrays are often needed), text processing tools (regexps, strings as arrays of characters, splitting) and mathematical functions.

For the extra challenge, I used **C** and **C++** for some tasks. Modern C++ actually provides much of the same tools as Python. C only works for the simplest tasks for me, more complex ones would be impossible or at least would take me weeks instead of hours.

Other modern languages like JavaScript, Ruby, Go or Rust would work too, but I don't know them well enough. And some awesome people intentionally chose wrong tool for the job and solved the challenges with Bash, Excel, SQL, m4 or even jq.

## Getting help

I always tried to solve the tasks by myself first. In most cases, I managed, and only later I googled for other people's solution to see possible improvements. In a few cases, I got stuck and needed some help.

One good source are Reddit threads, they generally show up as a first Google result for "advent of code year 20xx day yy". An even better source, and an inspiration for my site, is [Dazboâ€™s Advent of Code Walkthroughs](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/).
