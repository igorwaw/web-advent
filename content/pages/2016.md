We have a villain this year - Easter Bunny. We need to infiltrate
it's HQ which might require some pathfinding skills, we will crack
their codes and work with unusual hardware. That was fun.

I experimented with Github Copilot for the first 4 tasks, then
I disabled it. I didn't even wait till the end of my trial.
It only saves me a few seconds of typing for repeatable simple
things like opening files or iterating. When I'm into writing
a real algorithms, the suggestions are usually wrong, but 
distracting.
