We're looking at a list of "IPv7" addresses and need to find those that contain specific
sequences of repeated characters.

I used two different methods. For part 1 - the obvious way, regular expressions with backreferences.
I hate them, though I seem to be getting better at them.

But I couldn't write the right regexp for part 2. Instead, I found it easier to do some C-style coding in Python:
process string as a character array and use a very simple state machine (with just 2 states: inside and
outside the square brackets). I'm looking for all ABA blocks, store them in two sets (actually I just store AB),
separately for inside and outside square brackets. Then it's just checking if the two sets have any elements in common.
The important thing is to reverse characters for one of the sets.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import re

INPUTFILE="07-input.txt"


rx1=re.compile(r"(\w)(\w)\2\1")  # check for reversed pair, eg. abba, but will also catch aaaa
rx2=re.compile(r"\[\w*(\w)(\w)\2\1\w*]") # check for reversed pair in square brackets
rx3=re.compile(r"(\w)\1{3}") # check for "reversed pair" of same characters



def check_tls(line):
    if rx2.search(line):
            return False
    if rx3.search(line):
            return False
    if rx1.search(line):
            return True
    return False


def check_ssl(line):
    in_hyper_block=False
    hyper_matches=set()
    no_hyper_matches=set()
    for i in range(len(line)-2): # we're looking 2 characters ahead from current index
        if line[i]=="[":
            in_hyper_block=True
        elif line[i]=="]": 
            in_hyper_block=False
        elif line[i]==line[i+2] and line[i]!=line[i+1]:   # found aba block
            if in_hyper_block:
                hyper_matches.add(line[i]+line[i+1])
            else:
                no_hyper_matches.add(line[i+1]+line[i]) # reverse block
        if hyper_matches & no_hyper_matches:
            return True
    return False


tlscount=0
sslcount=0
with open(INPUTFILE) as f:
    for line in f:
        line=line.strip()
        if check_tls(line):
            tlscount+=1
        if check_ssl(line):
            sslcount+=1

print("Part 1, TLS addresses: ", tlscount)
print("Part 2, SSL addresses: ", sslcount)
```
